## Getting Started
A port of the Flash/AS3 Flint Particle System to Dart and Flutter.

To edit particles, we use the "Free Texture Packer" app. See: http://free-tex-packer.com/

This is a hand-tuned port of the Flint Particle system from ActionScript 3 to Dart/Flutter.
Only the 2D aspects of the library have been ported and distinctions between classes such as Particle
and Particle have been eliminated.
